Thermostat pairing challenge

Specification:

Tick - Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
Tick - You can increase the temperature with an up function
Tick - You can decrease the temperature with a down function
Tick - The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
Tick - If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
Tick - If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
Tick - Power saving mode is on by default but it can also be turned off
Tick - You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
Tick - You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, <= 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.
Ben's Note: the last test had to be moved to the 'when power saving is off' section to allow the temp to exceed 25 in the test.


(In the challenges where we add an interface, low-usage will be indicated with green, medium-usage indicated with black, high-usage indicated with red.)
